## How EEG (Electroencephalography) Works?
 The brain is essentially neutral in charge, but individual neurons are charged and the neutrality is balanced by a equal and opposite charge on another neuron (formation of dipole).
 
 Pyramidal neurons are a cluster of neurons arranged parallel to each other and perpendicular to the scalp (near the scalp surface). The cluster of pyramidal neurons together gets positively or negatively charged.
 Charge due to individual neurons is too small to be detected, but the cluster of pyramidal neurons creates a significant measurable amount of charge.

We can connect electrodes to any two distant points on the scalp and study the potential difference between the two points to understand the brain activity.
In EEG, several such electrodes are connected and the potential difference can be measured with either a common reference electrode or can be measured between adjacent electrodes.
